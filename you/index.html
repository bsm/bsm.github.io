<h1>Who are you?</h1>
<h2>The Pledge</h2>
<p>
<img alt='Idea!' class='pull-right' src='/images/bulb-80eb913f.png'>
One or the other way, it all usually starts with a <strong>fantasic idea</strong>.
One that is definitely going to change the (on-line) world &ndash; forever!
You study the market, check out competition, do all your important home work, crunch through numbers, make your all important business plan, and &ndash;
if it all adds up &ndash; hurray! I bet you always wanted to be your own boss.
</p>
<p>
Indulging in daydreaming about a <strong>glorious future</strong> as an entrepreneur is the sweetest period in every venture.
It is energising, motivating and (unfortunately) preciously short, because inevitable, reality will catch up with you rather sooner than later.
There is no reason not to get a little carried away though, just make sure that you are always prepared and are on top of your game.
</p>
<p>
To get your idea right you will need people you can trust, people who can support you and who cam help you through the (most certainly) rocky start.
On the other hand, you will also need help <strong>turning your dream into reality</strong>.
It's <em>no good</em> if it's just in your head, so get help from someone who knows how to create, present and roll-out <strong>real products</strong>
(not just prototypes). Get yourself as much advice as possible to get your strategy right and focus on excellence from the very early beginning.
You will inevitably need cash, and just something that <em>could</em> be amazing is usually not enough to convince investors,
unless you have a strong business case with hard facts and enough evidence to support it.
</p>
<h2>The Turn</h2>
<p>
By now, you should know that start-up life is not all sweet, but congratulations, you made it through the first few rounds and you are still standing.
If you were <strong>really clever</strong> (or lucky, or both) you might be even leading by points. But you know,
tough battles are rarely won by brute force, you need something really smart and inventive only to get you successfully
through the next rounds, but to make victory yours, you will need to <strong>keep momentum</strong>
and present yourself in the best possible shape. Sometimes, the package is as important as the content.
</p>
<p>
Fact is, you may have not broken even yet, but you hopefully managed to generate some revenue and you probably have knocked on some VC's doors.
Investors have learned they lessons from the &ndash; not so very distant &ndash; past. As they can easily spot mistakes in your business model,
make sure that you've done your homework! Show your best side, and learn from other successful entrepreneurs.
You might have been cash-strapped for a while, but resist temptation: Don't offer too much and don't sell yourself at any less than the fair value.
Show strength, but ensure it's justified. Don't rest on your laurels and always work on your products:
upgrade and revise, rinse and repeat! Push for quality &ndash; and invest in your reputation. It will precede you!
</p>
<p>
With a strong partner at your side you will make your dreams and visions come true! By employing the know-how of professionals,
it will take you faster to your goal as you can get by yourself! Are you ready for the next round?
</p>
<h2>The Prestige</h2>
<p>
Ok, you've certainly done a few things right. Otherwise, you wouldn't be here.
You took the full rollercoaster ride (with all it's highs and lows) and made it to the home straight.
Surely, everything is on track now: customers love your products, there is lots of buzz going on, and
cash is (finally) flowing in. So what could possibly go wrong now? There is absolutely no way someone
could mess up your big sucess story now, or is there?
</p>
<p>
There are actually still quite quite a few hidden traps in your way. Ask yourself this: with all your
the initial constrants and obstacles gone, and your survival secured, do you really have more time to
focus on your business? Are you really able to plan your next coup, OR are you spending most of your
precious time <em>fire-fighting</em>?
</p>
<p>
As every other organisation you had to make compromises during your growth phase. You had to scale
quickly and built up <em>technical debt</em>. Now, you have to pay interest for these initial
compromises, but it prevents you from focussing on your long-term business strategy.
</p>
<p>
We believe that you should be doing what you do best: building, expanding and growing your business.
Overall innovation and progress shouldn't be halted by some technology choices made in the past.
Let us help you with your <em>debt management</em> &ndash; we certainly can help you to find the right strategy.
We can move your technology to the next level, so you can finally focus on what really matters.
